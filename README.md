# Week 8 Recap

Congratulations - as we've said before, you are now developers and have built a foundation in full stack engineering, Agile methodologies, and teamwork. We hope you're excited about your project next week!

For this weekend, we'd like you to use at least an hour per day to isolate any concepts we've covered in the course so far that you want to go back to and have more practice so you're ready to hit the ground running with your project team. This can include:

- Finishing or redoing any previous workshops
- Reading/watching resources online
- Building, experimenting, and practicing with code (front end and/or back end)

Use this repository to document what you choose to do to reinforce your learning. It'll be a great snapshot of where you were in your journey pre-project week that you can look back on later in the course.

- Reflect and document in this repo's readme (concepts you clarified, links you found useful, which workshops you went back to, what you chose to build and why, etc.).
- Commit what you build and the code you write to this repo.
